# Peter Fisher's lounge chat on weather & climate

- The importance of observations
    - Weather logs from Shackleton's Aurora voyage 100 years ago.
    - In the historical logs, they didn't see icebergs until 60 South. But we saw them for the first time on this voyage at around 57 South.
    - The more data we have, the better we can forecast especially for people living in areas vulnerable to climate change.
- Differences between NZ, NZ's subantarctic islands, and South Georgia
    - Sharp difference in ocean temp after Antarctic Convergence - colder, with warmer air on top = condenses to fog.
- Ocean & atmosphere strongly linked
    - Ocean one of our biggest carbon sinks & temperature regulators (absorbed 90% of recent warming)
- How does it link to us in NZ?
    - Subantarctic is where most of NZ's weather is brewed - makes sense to do more weather ob & research here.
    - Southern Annular Mode (SAM) - a weather system like la nina and el nino. Drives westerly winds.
    - Oceanic drivers of weather - higher ocean temperatures = more power for tropical cyclones; sea level rise - big for flooding. +30cm around NZ in recent times.
