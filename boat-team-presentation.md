- Humans emit CO2 + methane + nitrous oxide
- Warm blanket effect on Earth, global temps increase
- Permafrost & snow melt increases sea level -> floods
    - Talk about positive feedback loop
- Ocean acidification & warming -> phytoplankton etc. dies, cornerstone of food chain.
    - Ocean absorbs CO2 via seaweed/green plankton matter that dies & sinks to bottom & fossilizes into layers of fossil fuels under the sea floor (offshore drilling is punching through that sea floor and getting to those layers of fossil fuels, burning it, and putting it back in the atmosphere - which we obviously don't want to be doing, but some parties this election are keen to scrap the ban on it)
    - Less phytoplankton = less absorption = more CO2 in atmosphere = more warming = more ocean warming/acidification = less phytoplanklton (positive feedback loop)
    - Kelp makes heaps of the oxygen we breathe. Overfishing, ocean acidification etc. hurts this - marine reserves help.

- We're all here, and it's very sad. But tbh, Earth will be fine. The Earth has had catastrophic extinction events in the past (although people are now calling the Anthropocene the "Sixth Extinction", this time manmade), and new species have emerged in the past to new global ecosystems each time. It really sucks that we're bringing on this extinction ourselves, from our overconsumption. But Earth will be fine, but humanity won't be. We, homo sapiens, are one species. So yes, let's do it to save the penguins, the whales, the icebergs. But mostly, it's kind of our human civilisation as we know it that's most at risk.


What can we do?

- The thing I love the most about climate action though, is that its solutions does not mean going back to the stone ages. It doesn't mean sacrificing human thriving. 
- NZ can make a difference
- Contributions to science
    - Christchurch is gateway city to Antarctica
    - Weather observations like this in and around Antarctica, and also the Pacific Islands at the frontlines of climate change - part of the WMO, sharing data & findings.
- Reducing our emissions
    - NZ has one of the highest per capita emissions worldwide
        - If we kept all our agricultural emissions in our profile, and excluded all of China's manufacturing, our per capita emissions would still be higher than that of China's.
        - So we have already made a difference in the wrong direction, by emitting many times our fair share of emissions (we are 0.06% of global population but have emitted 1.3%, i.e. 22 times our fair share)
        - Small countries combined = China + India
    - We're fortunate to be one of the wealthier countries that can afford to make change - this is a political choice. What's more, there is so much opportunity when it comes to adapting and mitigating climate change.
        - "What if it was all a hoax and we created a better world for nothing?"
        - Climate change is going to change everything. It's up to us whether we front foot it, or be trashed by it. 
    - We've always punched above our weight when it comes to making change at a global scale - women's suffrage, peaceful protest at Parihaka, diverse & representative Parliament.
        - So why not now, when the survival of humanity depends on it?
        - Why are some people choosing to say now that we're too small to make a difference? (because it's politically/financially convenient?)
    - In the words of Rod Carr, that would be like saying every kiwi soldier who died in every war should have saved their breath, because we weren't going to make much of a difference anyway.
- NZ is not too small to make a difference. We can do it, and it's up to each and every one of us on this incredible journey to 

- We heard from Pablo about how the planet has been through many climate changes. The current change we are experiencing is different in that it's man-made, and that it's rapid - not millions of years, but decades. The thing that's similar is that it's going to completely change the way our world looks, and the kinds of species that can survive on it. For context, the previous Ice Age was ~XC cooling, Xm years ago there was a trap event due to a supervolcano which caused ~8C warming. If we keep going in our current trajectory, we are heading towards 8C of warming. Current commitments (which no country on earth is on track to meet) is 3C, current policies is 2C, and if we were to massively improve our policies now, we might hit 1.5C as long as we peak our emissions by 2025 (in 14 months).
- It's not the expensive technofixes, it's not covering every glacier on earth (Pablo told us how the trash and the emissions from helicopter trips emitted more than it saved), it's not spraying reflective particles into our atmosphere, it's not unvalidated methane vaccines for dairy cows, it's not even getting everyone driving EVs which obviously has issues with mining/heavy metals/not everyone can afford an EV.
- It's common sense stuff - reducing emissions
- As Pablo mentioned, individual action and lifestyle choice yes, but the real solution lies in collective, systemic, policy-level action.
    - Making good easy, making bad impossible/undesirable/illegal.
    - Things like cycle lanes and free/accessible/reliable/fast public transport which free up the roads we already have for the elderly, the disabled, the single mums with 3 kids who really do need to drive (without traffic) - transport is 20% of our emissions.
    - Reducing our absolute dependence on cars and planes by providing more options: Advocating for passenger rail - we have extensive rail between regions in the 70s and 80s, so it is clearly feasible from a population density and affordability perspective.
    - Denser housing means less urban sprawl, less transport emissions, more connected communities, thriving local businesses.
    - Diversifying our exports for a more climate resilient economy.
    - Funding community solar, or creating one on your own - organising with your local school, church, community hall about getting a solar panel up there, which makes for a more distributed community-owned energy system that is more resilient to blackouts and extreme weather.
    - Local food systems, community gardens, which are again more distributed and therefore resilient to extreme weather; and also likely cheaper for cost of living and transport emissions.
