# Mangopare ocean temp

## 6 oct - salisbury plain

### Observations

Near iceberg
54°3′16″ S  37°22′4″ W
2 measurements (first one might not have settled on temperature properly)

### Data

- MOANA_0870_16.csv
- There is only one set of recordings (depth increases and decreases, indicating the sensor going down and up).
- We're not sure if this is for the correct recording, because:
    - there's only 1 recording, not 2
    - the timestamp seems to be several days behind (we took the recording on 6 Oct, but the timestamp says 1 Oct - even converted to UTC it wouldn't be right)

## 8 oct - godthul

### Observations

This is with the second sensor (the dark blue one) since we lost the first yellow one on 7 Oct, when the fishing line snapped.

This time we were using a rope on a hand reel which was much more effective.

Off the boat ramp
54°17′32″ S  36°17′45″ W
Depth 70.3m, 72.5m
around 10:30am, big gap between first and second readings due to waiting for passengers to disembark

Near iceberg ~10:45am
54°17′47″ S  36°18′13″ W
Depth 13.8m, 14.5m
2 readings

About 120m from shore ~11:00am
54°17′55″ S  36°17′47″ W
Depth 47.5m, 46.1m
2 readings

### Data

- MOANA_0161_52.csv
- Timestamp says last reading was 23-10-06 14:49:51. The time we took the last readings (forgot to take exact time, woops - assuming around 11am) was 23-10-08 10:49:51 (UTC-2). So **the timestamp on the Mangōpare sensor is 1 day 18 hours behind**.
- 5 recordings (not 6?) over a 50 min period which sounds about right.
    - I think the first early recording didn't stick (the first one from the ship), because there was a long break between the first and second readings as we were waiting for people to disembark from zodiacs.
- The length of the rope must be ~25m based on the recordings (in 2 of the sites, the depth was 40-70m and the sensor did not hit the bottom). We'll have to come up with some better rope.

## 8 oct - Grytviken

### Observations

Almost outside bay
54°16′56″ S  36°30′10″ W
Depth 24.4m, 24.9n
Time 3:05pm, 2 readings, finished at 3:13pm

### Data

TO DO

## 9 Oct - Gold Harbour

### Observations

Almost outside bay
54°37′29″ S  35°56′18″ W
Also deployed wave buoy
Depth 15m
Time 9:34am

Closer to shore south of glacier
54°37′50″ S  35°56′36″ W
Depth 16m
Time 9:45am

Even closer to shore
54°37′50″ S  35°56′48″ W
12.9 depth
9:55am

North side of shore
54°37′9″ S  35°56′13″ W
10.1m
10:19am

### Data

- Definitely the last section of MOANA_0161_53.csv because the timestamps and depths match very well.

## 9 oct - Drygalski Fjord

### Observations

Taken at end of fjord in front of glacier.
Lots of icebergs around.

Didn't take GPS recordings but it was around 54°45′35″ S  36°7′44″ W (this GPS location was taken quite a bit out from the end of the fjord)

At end of fjord

100m back out of fjord

2 readings each at 2 sites
Depth according to map is 0m (land where glacier would have been) but the glaciers have melted/receded so much that we are now floating in it) but from bridge it was 200m.

### Data

- MOANA_0161_54.csv
- Assuming same timestamp discrepancy of 1 day + 18 hours behind.


## 10 oct - St Andrews' Bay & Ocean Harbour

### Observations

Not sure if we took measurements at St Andrew's Bay.
Based on timestamps, looks like the measurements here are from Ocean Harbour (we were there in the afternoon around 3pm).


### Data

- MOANA_0161_55.csv
- Assuming same timestamp discrepancy of 1 day + 18 hours behind.
